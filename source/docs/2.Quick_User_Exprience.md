<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_1/media/image2.png" class="common_img" />

* **Start the Robot**

Turn on the switch on the Jetson Nano expansion to start the robot. For detailed guideline, please refer to the tutorial locating in [1.Getting Ready->1.4 Initial Startup]() .

### 2.1.2 Device Connection

Once the robot successfully starts up, it will create a WiFi starting with the letter **"HW"**. Connect the app to this WiFi to access and enjoy the games on the app.

There are two available connection modes, and detailed connection instructions are provided below.

* **Introduction to Connection Mode**

Here are the two network modes for the robot dog:

① AP Direct Connection Mode: The controller can create a hotspot to be connected to by a mobile phone (although it cannot access external networks).

② STA Local Area Network (LAN) Mode: The controller can actively connect to a specified hotspot/Wi-Fi (allowing access to external networks).

LAN mode and direct connection mode cannot be active simultaneously. The robot dog defaults to AP Direct Connection mode. Whether users choose AP Direct Connection or STA LAN mode, the game functionality remains consistent.

It is recommended for users to experience the robot functions under direct connection mode.

* **Direct Connection Mode Connection (MUST READ)**

The connection procedure outlined below is based on the Android system but is also applicable to the iOS system.

Start **"ROSPug"** first.
    

① Open **"WonderROS"** app, then select **"ROSPug"**.
